Problems with Good Fences:
1) Common Chest appears in same tile as Shipping Bin
2) Chests belonging to players are not marked by owner
3) Chests are accessible by all players for opening, placing and picking up items regardless of owner
4) Chests are strikable and can be picked up by players other than owner
5) Cabin cellar is the Farmhouse cellar: go in cabin, enter cellar, come out of cellar into farmhouse.
6) Fertilizer and Speed-gro do not work together: placement of one results in "This tile is already fertilized" when trying to place the other
7) Can't place two coops in multiplayer: Katie's placement spawned coop (she went to bed first), Stanley's left stake in place, no coop, Katie's coop was tagged to Stanley
8) Crops are not enforced: Stanley can use pickaxe to destroy Katie's crops
